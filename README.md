# Amazon Redshift Cross-Account Backup for Financial Services

This AWS sample demonstrates three approaches for implementing cross-account Amazon Redshift backup solutions, specifically designed for Financial Services Industry (FSI) airgap and disaster recovery requirements.

1. **Native Amazon Redshift Snapshot Sharing** - Direct cross-account snapshot sharing with manual scripts
2. **AWS Lambda-Based Automation** - Serverless automation of native snapshot sharing (recommended)
3. **AWS Backup Integration** - Centralized backup management with cross-account capabilities

## Demo Components

### Infrastructure
- CloudFormation templates for all approaches
- VPC, subnets, KMS keys, and IAM roles
- Redshift cluster in source account
- Backup vaults and networking in target account

### Automation Options
- **Manual Scripts**: Python scripts for testing and one-off operations
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless automation with EventBridge scheduling
- **AWS Backup**: Managed service with built-in automation

### Documentation
- Detailed setup guides and troubleshooting
- Cost analysis and feature comparison
- Best practices and security considerations

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Full Demo Environment
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh          # Deploy infrastructure
python3 scripts/native_snapshot_demo.py    # Test native approach
python3 scripts/aws_backup_demo.py         # Test AWS Backup
./cleanup.sh               # Clean up resources
```

### Option 2: Lambda-Based Production Solution (Recommended)
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh          # Deploy infrastructure
./deploy-lambda-backup.sh  # Deploy serverless automation
# Automated backups now running on schedule
```

### Option 3: AWS Backup Solution
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh          # Deploy infrastructure (includes AWS Backup)
# Automated backups running via AWS Backup service
```

### Key Components

- **Production Account**: Contains the live Amazon Redshift cluster and backup automation
- **DR Account**: Isolated environment for disaster recovery with cross-account access
- **Three Approaches**: Choose based on your operational requirements and compliance needs
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption using AWS KMS customer-managed keys
- **Automation**: Serverless scheduling with AWS Lambda and EventBridge (recommended)

This solution supports Financial Services regulatory requirements for:
- **Data Residency**: Cross-account isolation with controlled access
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup and restoration capabilities  
- **Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trails and encryption
- **Cost Optimization**: Multiple approaches to balance cost and features
