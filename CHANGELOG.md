## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

This release provides a complete solution for ACA Redshift cross-account backup requirements with three distinct approaches:

1. **Native Manual Scripts** - Perfect for testing and development environments
2. **Lambda-Based Automation** - Recommended for production with cost optimization
3. **AWS Backup Integration** - Enterprise solution with advanced compliance features

The Lambda-based approach is recommended for most ACA use cases, providing:
- 50% cost savings compared to AWS Backup
- Serverless automation with no infrastructure overhead
- Production-ready monitoring and alerting
- Flexible scheduling and retention policies

All resources use the `aca-` prefix for consistent branding and easy identification.

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)

### Migration Guide
- None (initial release)

### Known Issues
- Lambda function timeout limited to 15 minutes (suitable for most cluster sizes)
- Cross-region backup requires additional configuration
- Manual cleanup may be required for very old snapshots created outside the system

### Support
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory
- Example configurations and deployment scripts
- Troubleshooting guides and best practices
- Community support through GitHub issues
